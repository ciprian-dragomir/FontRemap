# FontRemap
A simple font utility which facilitates the creation of auxiliary font files by re-mapping character codes to arbitrary glyphs. Pertinent strings can then be ‘enciphered’ such that they are only legible under the generated font and vacuous otherwise. This technique can be employed, for instance, to prohibit copying displayed text onto the clipboard.
